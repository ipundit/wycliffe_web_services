Dear $firstName,<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Wycliffe Web Services Command processor. Reply to this email and attach <a href="http://www.wycliffe-services.net/email/tests/sample.csv">sample.csv</a>, along with any files to be forwarded to perform those web service calls. Then click send.  Because it's an email, you can forward the email from your sent box to perform the same command again.<br>
<br>
You can also try out the <a href="http://www.wycliffe-services.net/command">web interface</a>, or read the <a href="https://sharing.teamwork-global.net/content/command">full documentation</a>.<br>
<br>
Other than the attached files, there is only one other parameter to configure:<br>
<b>simulate:</b> 0 # Set simulate = 1 to run through all the checks but not actually process the commands
