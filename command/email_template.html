Dear $firstName,

<p>Welcome to the Wycliffe Web Services Command processor. You can email a list of web service calls according to the 
template between the horizontal lines, or attach a command file named <b>sample.csv</b> in a format similar to <a href="http://www.wycliffe-services.net/email/tests/sample.csv">this sample</a>.
The result of the last web service call will be emailed back to you.  And because it's an email, you can forward the email from your sent box to perform the same command again.</p>
<p>You can also try out the <a href="http://www.wycliffe-services.net/command">web interface</a>, or read the <a href="https://sharing.teamwork-global.net/content/command">full documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The following sample web call will call the <a href="https://sharing.teamwork-global.net/content/email">email web service</a>.
Just set the fromName and to parameters to your own email.  Text outside of the horizontal lines will be ignored by the email processor, except for the simulate parameter.</p>
